# 🎯 Meeting Customers Where They Are  
_A Human Take on Relevance in Content Marketing_

---

## 1. 🌱 Jamalu’s Take: A Gentle Overview

When we say “meet your customers where they are,” we’re not just talking about location — we’re talking about **mindset, need, and timing**.

Whether they’re searching late at night for a solution, scrolling during lunch, or feeling stuck in a decision — your content should **speak to that moment**.

Imagine content that feels like it knew what the reader was going through.  
That’s what we call **eerily relevant** — content so on point, it feels personal.

## 2. 🤔 Why This Matters (Especially for Freelancers & Creators)

Clients don’t just want traffic — they want **connection**.  
And connection comes from content that understands the user’s situation deeply.

As a freelancer, this means:
- You become more than a writer — you become a **message strategist**.
- Your content becomes **emotionally aligned** with the reader’s needs.
- Your value increases — because you don’t just write, you **resonate**.

## 3. 🔑 Key Concepts Explained Simply

### **Customer Awareness Levels**  
Your content should match what your reader knows, feels, and needs at that moment.

| Stage                  | What They're Thinking                        | What They Need from You             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Unaware                | “I don’t even know I have a problem.”        | Gentle stories or curiosity hooks  
| Problem-Aware          | “Something’s off, but I’m not sure what.”    | Clarity + connection  
| Solution-Aware         | “I want to solve this. Show me how.”         | Tips, guides, practical help  
| Product-Aware          | “I know you — convince me.”                  | Trust-building content  
| Most Aware             | “I’m ready. Let’s do it.”                    | CTAs, offers, sign-up pages

## 5. 💼 How It Shows Up in Client Work or Projects

Let’s say you’re writing for a skincare brand.  
If you write “5 Ingredients That Nourish Dry Skin During Winter,” you’re speaking to a **real seasonal pain point**.

If you’re writing for a SaaS tool, instead of “How to Use XYZ Software,” try:
> “Feeling Overwhelmed by Team Chaos? Here’s How One Tool Brought Back Calm.”

These are **context-aware**, human-centered pieces that actually connect.

## 7. 💬 How to Explain This to a Client (Even If You’re New)

> “I focus on writing content that connects to your audience’s current reality — so it doesn’t just inform, it lands. That leads to more shares, more conversions, and more trust.”

Clients love the word **relevance** — and even more when you **prove** it through tone, timing, and traffic.

## 8. ✍️ Mini Practice Prompt / Content Creation Task

Pick any product or service. Now answer:

- What is the **reader feeling** right before they search for this?

## 9. 🧭 The Soul of This Idea — What You Should Never Forget

**Relevance beats reach.**  
You don’t need to speak to everyone — just the **right person at the right moment**.

If your content makes someone feel, “Wow, this is exactly what I needed today,”  
— then you’ve already won.

## 🌍 Fictional Context Example (Optional)

Zara, a junior writer at ContentHaven, once wrote a blog titled “How to Get Your First Client on Fiverr.”  
It flopped.

Tariq helped her rewrite it as:  
> “Still Waiting for Your First Fiverr Order? Here's the Advice I Wish I Got on Day 1.”

Same topic. New tone.  
The second one felt like it **understood the reader’s frustration** — and that made all the difference.
