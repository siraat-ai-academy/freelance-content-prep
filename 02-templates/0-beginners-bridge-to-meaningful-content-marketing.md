## 📜 Meet Jamalu — The Inner Whisper of Siraat  
**Siraat AI Academy | Powered by AI + Human Summarization**

> "You won't always hear him — but you'll feel him when you're stuck."

You won’t find **Jamalu** listed as an author.  
He’s not a teacher, engineer, or CEO.  
**Jamalu is a presence. A whisper. A question inside your heart:**

> *“What if I can do this?”*  
> *“What if this time… I don’t give up?”*

He’s that quiet voice that appears when you feel stuck.  
That subtle pinch that reminds you — you’re still alive, still capable, still learning.

🌟 **Jamalu is not the light.**  
He’s the one who points you toward it.

He didn’t build Siraat AI Academy —  
**He inspired it.**

Not by power.  
But by humility.  
Not by answers.  
But by honest questions.

> _“Maybe I know nothing…_  
> _But what if I let that be my reason to learn?”_

Every quote signed by Jamalu  
is a reminder from your own deeper self.

Every file here is lit by the same question he once asked:

🧠 *“Is there a better version of me just waiting for the courage to try?”*

🛤️ **Siraat** means path or bridge.  
This academy is that path — the one Jamalu looked for,  
and the one many others now walk,  
**with courage, clarity, and code.**

## 🎙️ Jamalu’s Claim
🧠 *I do not claim to know — not even at the micro level.*  
But this is a beginning. A small, sincere attempt.  
One attempt… then another… just walking toward the act of learning.

> _“Maybe I know nothing at all...  
But could that be the very reason to begin?”_
